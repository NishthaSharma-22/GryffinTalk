this is a simple harry potter-themed chat app. i built this to learn backend dev and api usage. it's not meant to be super fancy - just a little experiment in react :)

### tech stack:
react, nodejs, hc chat generation api

### the process
i started this project to learn backend dev, since that's always been kinda scary to me. i used nodejs for the first time every - it was kinda weird getting used to it, and i spent waaaayyyy too much time on figuring out how to use the openai and gemini apis for the chat functionality. lots of things broke along the way, and i am grateful they did coz i learnt a lot along the way

while fixing them all, i used up all the free openai and gemini credits (wish i knew about thunderclint earlier) so at the end i ended up using hc api - which turned out to be a lot more simpler.

deploying the app was not easy either - i switched platforms a lot, but at the end, it was all worth it as i am not intimidated by backend dev as much as i was before!
